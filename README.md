# About The Base

We have prepared two bases for this device.

The first base: It is respectively upstreamed from Marshmallow to Nougat, Oreo and Pie.

The second base: It is ported from a msm8953 device called "Vince" to make it up-to-date and more stable.

This base more stable and smooth compared to the other base.
